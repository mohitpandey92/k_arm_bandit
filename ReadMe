Here we simulate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit">k-arm bandit problem</a>
, which is one of the basic reinforcement learning problems. It's a simple excercise which illustrates the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. We  experimented training our agent with greedy (which always maximizes immediate reward) and epsilon-greedy (which mostly maximizes immediate reward but also occasionaly takes risk for exploring).
