Here we simulate [k-arm bandit problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit), which is one of the basic reinforcement learning problems. It's a simple excercise which illustrates the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. We experimented training our agent with greedy (which always maximizes immediate reward) and epsilon-greedy (which mostly maximizes immediate reward but also occasionaly takes risk for exploring). 

This particular excercise was taken from a [textbook by Sutton and Barto](http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2017nov5.pdf).
